EgretEvent objects, which are passed as parameters to event\n * listeners when an event occurs.The properties of the EgretEvent class carry basic information about an event, such as\n * the event's type or whether the event's default behavior can be canceled. For many events, such as the events represented\n * by the EgretEvent class constants, this basic information is sufficient. Other events, however, may require more detailed\n * information. Events associated with a touch tap, for example, need to include additional information about the\n * location of the touch event. You can pass such additional information to event listeners by extending the EgretEvent class,\n * which is what the TouchEvent class does. Egret API defines several EgretEvent subclasses for common events that require\n * additional information. Events associated with each of the EgretEvent subclasses are described in the documentation for\n * each class.The methods of the EgretEvent class can be used in event listener functions to affect the behavior of the event\n * object. Some events have an associated default behavior. Your event listener can cancel this behavior by calling the\n * preventDefault() method. You can also make the current event listener the last one to process an event by calling\n * the stopPropagation() or stopImmediatePropagation() method.\n * @see egret.EventDispatcher\n * @version Egret 2.4\n * @platform Web,Native\n * @includeExample egret/events/EgretEvent.ts\n * @see http://edn.egret.com/cn/docs/page/798 取消触摸事件\n */\n/**\n * @language zh_CN\n * EgretEvent 类作为创建事件实例的基类，当发生事件时，Event 实例将作为参数传递给事件侦听器。Event 类的属性包含有关事件的基本信息，例如事件\n * 的类型或者是否可以取消事件的默认行为。对于许多事件（如由 EgretEvent 类常量表示的事件），此基本信息就足够了。但其他事件可能需要更详细的信息。\n * 例如，与触摸关联的事件需要包括有关触摸事件的位置信息。您可以通过扩展 EgretEvent 类（TouchEvent 类执行的操作）将此类其他信息传递给事件侦听器。\n * Egret API 为需要其他信息的常见事件定义多个 EgretEvent 子类。与每个 EgretEvent 子类关联的事件将在每个类的文档中加以介绍。Event 类的方法可以在\n * 事件侦听器函数中使用以影响事件对象的行为。某些事件有关联的默认行为，通过调用 preventDefault() 方法，您的事件侦听器可以取消此行为。\n * 可以通过调用 stopPropagation() 或 stopImmediatePropagation() 方法，将当前事件侦听器作为处理事件的最后一个事件侦听器。\n * @see egret.EventDispatcher\n * @version Egret 2.4\n * @platform Web,Native\n *

The EventDispatcher class implements\n * the IEventDispatcher interface and is the base class for the DisplayObject class. The EventDispatcher class allows\n * any object on the display list to be an event target and as such, to use the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.\n * EgretEvent targets are an important part of the Egret event model. The event target serves as the focal point for how events\n * flow through the display list hierarchy. When an event such as a touch tap, Egret dispatches an event object into the\n * event flow from the root of the display list. The event object then makes its way through the display list until it\n * reaches the event target, at which point it begins its return trip through the display list. This round-trip journey\n * to the event target is conceptually divided into three phases: <br/>\n * the capture phase comprises the journey from the root to the last node before the event target's node, the target\n * phase comprises only the event target node, and the bubbling phase comprises any subsequent nodes encountered on\n * the return trip to the root of the display list. In general, the easiest way for a user-defined class to gain event\n * dispatching capabilities is to extend EventDispatcher. If this is impossible (that is, if the class is already extending\n * another class), you can instead implement the IEventDispatcher interface, create an EventDispatcher member, and write simple\n * hooks to route calls into the aggregated EventDispatcher.\n * @see egret.IEventDispatcher\n * @version Egret 2.4\n * @platform Web,Native\n * @includeExample egret/events/EventDispatcher.ts\n */\n/**\n * @language zh_CN\n * EventDispatcher 是 Egret 的事件派发器类，负责进行事件的发送和侦听。\n * 事件目标是事件如何通过显示列表层次结构这一问题的焦点。当发生鼠标单击、触摸或按键等事件时，\n * 框架会将事件对象调度到从显示列表根开始的事件流中。然后该事件对象在显示列表中前进，直到到达事件目标，\n * 然后从这一点开始其在显示列表中的回程。在概念上，到事件目标的此往返行程被划分为三个阶段：\n * 捕获阶段包括从根到事件目标节点之前的最后一个节点的行程，目标阶段仅包括事件目标节点，冒泡阶段包括回程上遇到的任何后续节点到显示列表的根。\n * 通常，使用户定义的类能够调度事件的最简单方法是扩展 EventDispatcher。如果无法扩展（即，如果该类已经扩展了另一个类），则可以实现\n * IEventDispatcher 接口，创建 EventDispatcher 成员，并编写一些简单的映射，将调用连接到聚合的 EventDispatcher 中。\n * @see egret.IEventDispatcher\n * @version Egret 2.4\n * @platform Web,Native\n * @includeExample egret/events/EventDispatcher.ts\n */\nexport class EventDispatcher implements IEventDispatcher {\n\n    /**\n     * @language en_US\n     * create an instance of the EventDispatcher class.\n     * @param target The target object for events dispatched to the EventDispatcher object.
